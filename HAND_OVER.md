# State of SISTEM
Due to incident on maintaining the SISTEM resources and sharing there were unauthorized accesses to the resources. An action taken was to logout all devices access to the Gmail. This resulted in loss of access to the Gmail, which resulted in loss of access to Bitwarden. This circular dependency can be resolved by contacting the original owner of the Gmail account whose phone number ends with `41`. 

We tried to gain access to the Gmail account by using the recovery email, but it was not successful. The recovery link was sent but it has expired upon clicking it. 

I believe the creator to be Adam Teehan, https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-teehan/, who might be able to help us regain access to the Gmail account. If Adam doesn't respond ask Milan to contact him.

## Explanation of each Role
- **Directory**: The main organizer of the event, responsible for overseeing all aspects of the event.
- **PRO**: Public Relations Officer, responsible for managing communications and public relations. You will be responsible for promoting the event via LinkedIn, Instagram, and other social media platforms. Also responsible for reaching out to potential guest speakers.
- **Treasurer**: Manages the financial aspects of the event, mainly expenses and orderings.
- **Web Tech**: Responsible for the technical aspects of the event, such as the website.
- **Graphic Artist**: Responsible for creating visual content for the event, such as posters and social media graphics.
- **Catering Assistant**: Assists with catering arrangements, such as ordering food and drinks for the event.
- **Sponsorship Manager**: Responsible for securing sponsorships and managing relationships with sponsors.

## Organizing next SISTEM
As directory, you will be overseeing the running of the next SISTEM event. It is important to start planning early, as it can take several months to organize a successful event. Here are some key steps to follow:
- Create a rough timeline from the very beginning, including deadlines for securing speakers, sponsors, and venues.
- Set a date for the event and book a venue as early as possible.
- Create a sponsorship package, outlining the benefits of sponsoring the event and the different sponsorship levels available. Ask for sponsors if they are interested in sending a representative and/or a guest speaker.
- Clearly outline the roles and responsibilities of each team member, and ensure that everyone is aware of their tasks and deadlines.

As sponsorships are coming in, you will be able to estimate the budget for the event. This will help you determine how much the tickets will costs. This is a non-profit event, so the goal is to break even. If you have any leftover funds, will be donated to a charity of the team's choice.

### Catering
Catering is an important aspect of the event, as it helps create a welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere for attendees. Here are some key points to consider:
- **Food and Drinks**: Consider vegan, gluten-free as your two main options. This will ensure that there is something for everyone to enjoy. There should be a survey sent out alongside with the ticket sales to determine the dietary requirements of the attendees.
- **Purchasing**: Going directly to the supplier is the best option. In 2025 we have used one of the local Limerick fruit and veg supplier to provide bananas, and apples for breakfast. We also used LIDL for croissants and pastries. **One of the key faults in the coffee provided was the lactoze-free option consideration** as all instant coffees were made with milk.
- **Pizzas and Lunch Boxes**: See sponsorships section for details on the pizzas and lunch boxes.

### Swag and Merchandise
We have a list of providers who are willing to do card nametags, lanyards, pens, stickers, and other merchandise. Get a quote from each and compare the prices. 

### Sponsorships
In 2025 we had issues obtaining sponsorships. Milan wanted to have the website up-to-date before reaching out to potential sponsors. This resulted in a delay in securing sponsorships, which in turn affected the budget for the event. It is recommended to start reaching out to potential sponsors as early as possible, even if the website is not fully ready.

What we did manage to secure was LERO (Research Ireland Centre for Software) to sponsor €500 towards catering which worked out with the deal we obtained from Supermacs and Papa John's for pizzas which was €10 per pizza. We had to subsidize for lactoze-free options, which was additional costs, for the chicken and chips lunch boxes.

### Guest Speakers
A lot of the guest speakers is trial and error. You send emails, LinkedIn messages, and if they respond, greate! If they don't, you move on to the next one.

### Venue 
In 2025 we used the Business School in UL, which was spacious and had has security on weekends which meant we didn't have to hire security. This resulted in booking the facilities free of charge.  
It is recommended in the the future hosting in UL to use the new Student Life building which will also be free of charge. This means the costs will only be catering, merchandise and speakers who require travel expenses.

### Volunteers
Volunteers are generally necessity but because of the size of the event in 2025 we didn't require any volunteers. Milan would only recommend volunteers to look after the student's entering, looking after and meeting guest speakers, and looking after the catering. Divide and conquer is the best approach.

## Conclusion
### 2025 Event
We had a successful event in 2025, with over 30 attendees and 5 guest speakers. Our overall income was around 800 euro, with expenses of around 1,200 euro. We leveraged the fund of the Computer Society in UL to cover the costs. The event was well-received, and we received positive feedback from attendees and guest speakers. We could accept this type of loss as it was the first event after the pandemic and make the name for SISTEM again.
